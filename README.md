# DriverR Backend

The DriverR Backend is the server-side component of the DriverR application, which provides a backend infrastructure to handle various functionalities related to driver management, company operations, hiring processes, job management, driver verification, interviews, and interview feedbacks. It serves as the core engine that processes requests, interacts with the database, and provides the necessary APIs for the frontend application to communicate with.

## Features

### Authentication and Authorization
- Handles user authentication and authorization
- Supports registration, login, and logout functionalities
- Implements role-based access control for different user types (admin, manager, etc.)
- Generates and validates JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure API communication

### Database Interaction
- Communicates with the database to store and retrieve data
- Utilizes an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library such as Sequelize or Mongoose for easy data modeling and querying
- Implements data validation and ensures data integrity

### API Endpoints
- Defines API endpoints for various operations such as driver management, company management, hiring processes, job management, driver verification, interviews, and interview feedbacks
- Handles incoming requests, processes data, and sends appropriate responses
- Implements validation and error handling for robust and secure API interactions

### Business Logic
- Implements the business logic for driver management, company operations, hiring processes, job management, driver verification, interviews, and interview feedbacks
- Handles complex workflows and validations specific to the DriverR application domain
- Orchestrates interactions between different components of the system

### Integration with Third-Party Services
- Integrates with external services for driver verification, document verification, or background checks
- Implements necessary APIs or adapters to communicate with external systems
- Ensures seamless data exchange and synchronization between DriverR and third-party systems

### Security and Data Privacy
- Implements necessary security measures to protect sensitive data
- Ensures secure communication between the frontend and backend through HTTPS
- Implements appropriate data privacy measures, such as encryption and access control, to safeguard user and driver information

### Scalability and Performance
- Optimizes the backend architecture for scalability and high performance
- Implements caching mechanisms to improve response times for frequently accessed data
- Fine-tunes database queries and optimizes database performance
- Implements load balancing and horizontal scaling techniques for handling increased traffic and user load

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code
- Express: A web application framework for Node.js
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing application data
- Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database for storing structured data
- Sequelize: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for PostgreSQL
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): A standard for securing web applications
- Passport: An authentication middleware for Node.js
- bcrypt: A library for hashing and salting passwords
- CORS: A middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- Helmet: A middleware for securing Express apps with various HTTP headers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ````shell
   git clone  https://github.com/alirazaztdev1/DriverR-Backend.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ````shell
   cd driverR-backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ````plaintext
   DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   ```

   Replace `your-database-url` with the URL of your MongoDB or PostgreSQL database, and `your-jwt-secret` with a secret key for JWT token generation.

4. Run the application:

   ````shell
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start running at the specified port (default: 3000).

## Usage

Once the backend server is up and running, it will handle API requests from the frontend application. The frontend application will interact with the backend through the defined API endpoints for driver management, company operations, hiring processes, job management, driver verification, interviews, and interview feedbacks.

You can customize the backend implementation according to your specific requirements and business logic. Modify the API endpoints, database interactions, and business logic to align with your application's needs.
